## Requirements

- qemu or any VM
- nasm or any assembler
- gcc or any C compiler
- A linker software on Windows builds or default GNU linker.

[!NOTE]
Optionally a Linux distro like Ubuntu, because easier and already has linker in it.

## Setup

`./build_i386.sh`
or
`build_i386.sh --fullcln`

You can build it via [build_i386.sh](build_i386.sh) and you can use `--fullcln` parameter for clean build.

[!IMPORTANT]
It automatically starts it. so just be sure you added correct files on [src](src/) in the `OBJS` value at the [src/Makefile](src/Makefile) and `LINKER_FILES` at the [build_i386.sh](build_i386.sh)
